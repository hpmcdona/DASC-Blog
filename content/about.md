My name is Hayden McDonald and I am a first year student at the University of Arkansas pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science. My interests are hiking, biking, and participating in STEM related activities. I am interested in Data Science because data literacy is essential to a succesful future and I find the subject interesting. There is a massive demand for Data Scientists across all areas of the job spectrum, so I like that freedom of being able to go anywhere and do anything instead of being held down to one area.
