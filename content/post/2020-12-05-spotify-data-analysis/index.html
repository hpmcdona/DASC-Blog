<li><p>Question 1: How does energy compare to the duration of a song? To test this I will create a chart, possibly a point or violin, to show dispersion and look for clustering at certain energy levels and times to see if there is a trend for how long high energy songs typically are and how long low energy songs are.

<li><p>Question 2: What are the 10 most popular songs? What genres show up more than once? To test this I will need to filter for genre, song name, and popularity and then arrange them in descending order. From there I will get a list of the top 10 popular songs and can see what genres show up more than once.</p></li>

<li>Question 3: How does speechiness compare to popularity? Is there a sweetspot? To test this I will need to graph speechiness against popularity and look for a trend, I will likely start with a point graph and change from there if there is a better solution that presents itself.

Seems to be a strange trend where it slopes downward from top popularity to around .4 speechiness and slopes upward from .12 popularity to .4 speechiness to form a triangular point. The ones at the bottom people hated for reasons other than speechiness.</li>
